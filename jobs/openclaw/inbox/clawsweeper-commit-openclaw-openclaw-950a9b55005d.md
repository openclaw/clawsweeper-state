# ClawSweeper commit finding repair

ClawSweeper Repair should create or update one implementation PR from `clawsweeper/clawsweeper-commit-openclaw-openclaw-950a9b55005d`
if the finding is still valid on latest `openclaw/openclaw@main`.

## Operator Prompt

Use the ClawSweeper commit report below as the source finding. Do not redo a
broad audit of the commit. Check latest `main`, verify the reported problem is
still present, and make the narrowest safe fix. If latest `main` already fixed
it, make no code changes and report that outcome.

Do not merge. Do not close issues. Do not handle security-sensitive findings in
this lane.

## Commit Finding

# Commit 950a9b5500

## Summary

Found one regression in the Discord startup/status probe path. The core 429 cooldown behavior is covered by focused tests, but the noncritical application-summary probe now inherits the new 60s fallback retry delay and can block startup/status far beyond its caller-provided timeout.

## Findings

### Medium: Discord application status probe can block startup for minutes on Cloudflare 429

- Kind: regression
- File: `extensions/discord/src/probe.ts`
- Line: 48
- Evidence: `fetchDiscordApplicationMe()` now calls `fetchDiscord("/oauth2/applications/@me", ...)` with default retry settings. For a 429 without `Retry-After`, `extensions/discord/src/api.ts:150` assigns a 60s fallback retry-after, and `retryAsync` sleeps between attempts. `probeDiscord()` uses this helper for `includeApplication: true`, while `extensions/discord/src/channel.ts:548` runs that probe before `monitorDiscordProvider()` starts. A focused smoke with `/users/@me` returning 200 and `/oauth2/applications/@me` returning Cloudflare HTML 429 did not complete within 5s even though `probeDiscord(..., 10, { includeApplication: true })` was called; it timed out externally with exit 124. Before this commit, the same non-ok application response returned `undefined` immediately from `fetchDiscordApplicationMe()`.
- Impact: a noncritical status enrichment request can delay Discord account startup and status probes by about 120s with default 3 attempts when Cloudflare omits `Retry-After`. That keeps the provider from starting even though the real startup path can now parse the application ID from the token and continue.
- Suggested fix: keep the cooldown for startup/allowlist REST calls, but make the application-summary probe bounded. For example, call `fetchDiscord` with `retry: { attempts: 1 }` from `fetchDiscordApplicationMe()`, or add an overall deadline/abort around retries so `probeDiscord` respects its `timeoutMs`.
- Confidence: high

## Reviewed

- Diff: `d4e88e7a2fe59ab0ba06393df5343d21c043aa1c..950a9b55005deb6d267f153fa367e373fafa918c`
- Changed files: `CHANGELOG.md`, `extensions/discord/src/api.ts`, `extensions/discord/src/error-body.ts`, `extensions/discord/src/monitor/gateway-metadata.ts`, `extensions/discord/src/probe.ts`, and related tests
- Code read: changed files in full; prior versions of `api.ts`, `probe.ts`, `gateway-metadata.ts`; callers in `extensions/discord/src/channel.ts`, `extensions/discord/src/monitor/provider.ts`, `extensions/discord/src/monitor/gateway-plugin.ts`, `extensions/discord/src/resolve-channels.ts`; retry and timeout helpers in `src/infra/retry.ts` and `src/utils/fetch-timeout.ts`
- Issue/PR context: `openclaw/openclaw#38853`, `openclaw/openclaw#73395`

## Tests / Live Checks

- `pnpm install` was required because `node_modules` was missing.
- `pnpm test extensions/discord/src/api.test.ts extensions/discord/src/monitor/gateway-metadata.test.ts extensions/discord/src/probe.intents.test.ts` passed: 3 files, 12 tests.
- `git diff --check d4e88e7a2fe59ab0ba06393df5343d21c043aa1c..950a9b55005deb6d267f153fa367e373fafa918c` passed.
- Focused `probeDiscord` smoke with Cloudflare HTML 429 on application lookup timed out under external 5s timeout, confirming the stall path.

## Dependency / Web Checks

- Read local retry/timeout implementation and `discord-api-types` route/type surface.
- No general web lookup was needed for the finding.

## Limitations

- Did not run broad `pnpm check:changed`; focused tests were sufficient for the touched Discord helper paths plus the targeted regression smoke.
