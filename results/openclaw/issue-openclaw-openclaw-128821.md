# issue-openclaw-openclaw-128821

Repo: openclaw/openclaw

Run: [https://github.com/openclaw/clawsweeper/actions/runs/32772024845](https://github.com/openclaw/clawsweeper/actions/runs/32772024845)

Workflow conclusion: success

Worker result: blocked

Canonical: https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/128821

## Summary

#128821 remains a valid canonical CLI bug on main a99317ef. Nested plugin help bypasses the existing precomputed-help path and reaches the unconditional route import in src/cli/run-main.ts:1500, although normalizedInvocation.hasHelpOrVersion is already true. A narrow guarded route-first block plus regression coverage is ready to implement. This worker could not edit or validate because the checkout is read-only, dependencies are absent, and ../codex is unavailable for the repository-required direct inspection.
