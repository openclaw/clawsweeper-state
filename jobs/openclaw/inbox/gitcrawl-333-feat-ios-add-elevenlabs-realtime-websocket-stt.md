# Gitcrawl Cluster 333

Generated from local gitcrawl run cluster 333 for `openclaw/openclaw`.

Display title:

> feat(ios): add ElevenLabs realtime WebSocket STT

Cluster shape from gitcrawl:

- total members: 4
- issues: 2
- pull requests: 2
- open candidates in local store: 2
- representative: #38744, currently closed in local store
- latest member update: 2026-06-28T08:01:18.728906079Z

## Goal

Run one live autonomous classification pass. Classify open candidates only, verify live GitHub state, choose the current canonical issue or PR if the representative is obsolete, and emit only high-confidence planned close/comment/label actions. Closed context refs are evidence only and must not receive close actions.

## Member Inventory

Closed context refs:

- #38744 feat(ios): add ElevenLabs realtime WebSocket STT
- #64318 feat: Add unified Amazon plugin — Polly TTS, Transcribe STT, Nova Sonic realtime voice

Open candidates:

- #47584 feat(ios): Siri App Intent integration — native "Hey Siri, ask OpenClaw..." support
- #71195 feat(talk/macOS): add OpenAI Realtime (speech-to-speech) path for Talk Mode — parity with the voice-call plugin's phone experience
