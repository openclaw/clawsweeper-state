# ClawSweeper commit finding repair

ClawSweeper Repair should create or update one implementation PR from `clawsweeper/clawsweeper-commit-openclaw-openclaw-225620a9b3e9`
if the finding is still valid on latest `openclaw/openclaw@main`.

## Operator Prompt

Use the ClawSweeper commit report below as the source finding. Do not redo a
broad audit of the commit. Check latest `main`, verify the reported problem is
still present, and make the narrowest safe fix. If latest `main` already fixed
it, make no code changes and report that outcome.

Do not merge. Do not close issues. Do not handle security-sensitive findings in
this lane.

## Commit Finding

- Commit: https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/commit/225620a9b3e9d6a232deeed50b9ba199e00df5a7
- Report: https://github.com/openclaw/clawsweeper/blob/main/records/openclaw-openclaw/commits/225620a9b3e9d6a232deeed50b9ba199e00df5a7.md

# Commit 225620a

## Summary

Found a concrete regression in Google Vertex env auth: ADC/gcloud credentials no longer resolve after the special-case fallback was replaced by generic manifest evidence, but the Google plugin manifest was not updated to provide that evidence. Also found a focused test-suite regression caused by an outdated partial mock.

## Findings

### Medium: Google Vertex ADC auth no longer resolves

- Kind: regression
- File: `src/agents/model-auth-env.ts`
- Line: 120
- Evidence: `resolveEnvApiKey()` now checks explicit env candidates, then `authEvidenceMap`, then returns `null` whenever a candidate list exists. The bundled Google manifest only declares `envVars: ["GOOGLE_CLOUD_API_KEY"]` for `google-vertex` and no `authEvidence` (`extensions/google/openclaw.plugin.json:74`), while `extensions/google/setup-api.ts:8` only registers the Gemini CLI backend, so there is no setup hook fallback for `google-vertex`. A direct production-path smoke returned `{"apiKey":{"apiKey":"gcp-test","source":"env: GOOGLE_CLOUD_API_KEY"},"adc":null}` for `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` + `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION` + `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`. Existing docs still say `google-vertex` auth uses gcloud ADC (`docs/concepts/model-providers.md:205`), and existing tests encode that ADC should resolve (`src/agents/model-auth.profiles.test.ts:818`, `src/agents/model-auth.profiles.test.ts:830`).
- Impact: users relying on gcloud ADC for `google-vertex` are no longer detected by env auth resolution, so model auth/list/status/probe/runtime paths can treat a valid Vertex setup as unauthenticated unless `GOOGLE_CLOUD_API_KEY` is set.
- Suggested fix: add `google-vertex` manifest `authEvidence` matching the removed fallback, including `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`, `${HOME}/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json`, required project/location env, marker `gcp-vertex-credentials`, and source `gcloud adc`; or restore the provider-specific fallback until the manifest evidence exists.
- Confidence: high

### Low: auth profile tests now fail before exercising resolver behavior

- Kind: regression
- File: `src/agents/model-auth.profiles.test.ts`
- Line: 92
- Evidence: this test file partially mocks `./model-auth-env-vars.js` but only returns `resolveProviderEnvApiKeyCandidates`; the commit added a new named import/use of `resolveProviderEnvAuthEvidence` in `src/agents/model-auth-env.ts:94`. Running `pnpm test src/agents/model-auth.profiles.test.ts -- --run` fails 35 tests with Vitest’s missing mock export error.
- Impact: the auth-profile suite is red and the existing Google Vertex ADC assertions do not actually run, which makes this regression easier to miss in CI.
- Suggested fix: update the mock to include `resolveProviderEnvAuthEvidence`, ideally as a partial mock with `importOriginal` or a deterministic empty/evidence map as appropriate.
- Confidence: high

## Reviewed

- Diff: `dd5b96c11dd03e7c7d2d215ae7c5d3be7774925e..225620a9b3e9d6a232deeed50b9ba199e00df5a7`
- Changed files: `src/agents/model-auth-env.ts`, `src/commands/models/list.auth-index.ts`
- Code read: changed files in full, previous parent version of `model-auth-env.ts`, provider env/evidence registry, Google plugin manifest/setup runtime, related auth tests, model-list auth index tests, relevant model-provider docs.
- Dependencies/web: no external web lookup needed; behavior is local repo code/docs.
- Commands: `pnpm docs:list`; `pnpm install`; `pnpm test src/commands/models/list.auth-index.test.ts -- --run`; `pnpm test src/agents/model-auth.profiles.test.ts -- --run`; direct `tsx` smoke for `resolveEnvApiKey("google-vertex", ...)`.

## Tests / Live Checks

- `pnpm test src/commands/models/list.auth-index.test.ts -- --run` failed: `checks resolver-only env auth on demand` expected `google-vertex` auth to be present but got `false`.
- `pnpm test src/agents/model-auth.profiles.test.ts -- --run` failed: 35 tests fail because the partial mock lacks `resolveProviderEnvAuthEvidence`.
- Direct smoke confirmed `GOOGLE_CLOUD_API_KEY` still resolves, but ADC credentials return `null`.

## Limitations

- Full suite and broad changed gate not run; targeted checks were sufficient to reproduce the regression.
