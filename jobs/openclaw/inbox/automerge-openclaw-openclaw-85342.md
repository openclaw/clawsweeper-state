Maintainer opted #85342 into ClawSweeper automerge.

Source PR: https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/85342
Title: fix(cli): recover replaced device approvals

ClawSweeper should use this job only for the bounded ClawSweeper review/fix loop:

- Emit a fix artifact with `repair_strategy: "repair_contributor_branch"` and `source_prs: ["https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/85342"]` so the Codex edit pass can make this PR merge-ready.
- The edit pass should rebase onto latest main, address PR comments and review findings, fix CI/check failures, add a changelog entry when required, run the relevant validation, and keep iterating until the branch is ready or an external blocker is proven.
- If the PR branch cannot be safely updated, emit a narrow credited replacement only when the artifact can preserve the original contributor credit; otherwise return `needs_human`.
- Never add forbidden changelog credit lines for `@codex`, `@openclaw`, or `@steipete`; preserve contributor credit through source links and commit/PR history.
- Do not merge, close, or bypass review gates from the worker. The comment router owns final merge only after a passing ClawSweeper verdict for the exact current head.
- Keep repair scope limited to actionable ClawSweeper findings, failing relevant checks, and required review feedback on this PR.
