# ClawSweeper commit finding repair

ClawSweeper Repair should create or update one implementation PR from `clawsweeper/clawsweeper-commit-openclaw-openclaw-5a631e1ee9fa`
if the finding is still valid on latest `openclaw/openclaw@main`.

## Operator Prompt

Use the ClawSweeper commit report below as the source finding. Do not redo a
broad audit of the commit. Check latest `main`, verify the reported problem is
still present, and make the narrowest safe fix. If latest `main` already fixed
it, make no code changes and report that outcome.

Do not merge. Do not close issues. Do not handle security-sensitive findings in
this lane.

## Commit Finding

- Commit: https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/commit/5a631e1ee9faf049c2bcc194f5240f2a30d21eb4
- Report: https://github.com/openclaw/clawsweeper/blob/main/records/openclaw-openclaw/commits/5a631e1ee9faf049c2bcc194f5240f2a30d21eb4.md

# Commit 5a631e1

## Summary

Found one Windows-specific reliability gap in the new timeout cleanup path.

## Findings

### Medium: Windows timeout path can return while the Codex child keeps running

- Kind: reliability
- File: `scripts/docs-i18n/codex_command_windows.go`
- Line: 7
- Evidence: the Windows implementation only sets `command.WaitDelay`; it leaves `exec.CommandContext`'s default `Cancel`, which Go documents as killing only `command.Process`. The local Codex CLI launcher is a Node shim that spawns the native Codex binary with inherited stdio and forwards only normal signals. On Windows, killing the shim process does not reliably kill that spawned native child, and `WaitDelay` only bounds `Wait`/pipe cleanup.
- Impact: after `OPENCLAW_DOCS_I18N_PROMPT_TIMEOUT`, docs-i18n can return and remove its temp output/CODEX_HOME while a native Codex process continues running, potentially consuming API time and leaving orphaned work. This is most likely on Windows npm-installed `codex`, where the command goes through a wrapper before the native binary.
- Suggested fix: give Windows a real process-tree cleanup path, such as running Codex in a Windows Job Object, using a carefully bounded `taskkill /T /F /PID <pid>` cancel path, or resolving/invoking the native Codex binary directly when possible.
- Confidence: medium

- Changed files: `scripts/docs-i18n/codex_command_unix.go`, `scripts/docs-i18n/codex_command_windows.go`, `scripts/docs-i18n/translator.go`, `scripts/docs-i18n/translator_test.go`
- Code read: changed files in full, `scripts/docs-i18n/main.go`, `scripts/docs-i18n/doc_mode.go`, `scripts/docs-i18n/process.go`, `scripts/AGENTS.md`
- Dependencies/web: local Go `os/exec.Cmd` docs; local installed Codex CLI launcher source; no web lookup needed

## Tests / Live Checks

- `pnpm docs:list`
- `go test ./...` from `scripts/docs-i18n`
- `GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go test -c -o /tmp/openclaw-docs-i18n-windows.test .`
- `GOOS=darwin GOARCH=arm64 go test -c -o /tmp/openclaw-docs-i18n-darwin.test .`
- `gofmt -l scripts/docs-i18n/codex_command_unix.go scripts/docs-i18n/codex_command_windows.go scripts/docs-i18n/translator.go scripts/docs-i18n/translator_test.go`
- `git diff --check a548d8e1eabf2a4cb8f6efc0e988115acef446ee..5a631e1ee9faf049c2bcc194f5240f2a30d21eb4`

## Limitations

- I did not run the docs-i18n runtime path on a Windows host; the finding is based on Go exec semantics and the Codex launcher process model.
