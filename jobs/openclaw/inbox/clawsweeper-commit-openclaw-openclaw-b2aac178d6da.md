# ClawSweeper commit finding repair

ClawSweeper Repair should create or update one implementation PR from `clawsweeper/clawsweeper-commit-openclaw-openclaw-b2aac178d6da`
if the finding is still valid on latest `openclaw/openclaw@main`.

## Operator Prompt

Use the ClawSweeper commit report below as the source finding. Do not redo a
broad audit of the commit. Check latest `main`, verify the reported problem is
still present, and make the narrowest safe fix. If latest `main` already fixed
it, make no code changes and report that outcome.

Do not merge. Do not close issues. Do not handle security-sensitive findings in
this lane.

## Commit Finding

# Commit b2aac17

## Summary

Found one concrete bug in the new webhook exposure checks: IPv6 loopback and unique-local webhook URLs are still treated as public/reachable, even though the commit and docs say local/private webhook URLs fail before joins.

## Findings

### Medium: IPv6 local/private webhook URLs pass the new exposure preflight

- Kind: bug
- File: `extensions/voice-call/src/webhook-exposure.ts`
- Line: 45
- Evidence: `isProviderUnreachableWebhookUrl()` passes `new URL(webhookUrl).hostname` into `isLocalOnlyWebhookHost()`. In Node, IPv6 URL hostnames are bracketed, for example `new URL("http://[::1]:3334/voice/webhook").hostname` returns `"[::1]"`, not `"::1"`. The helper compares against `"::"`, `"::1"`, and `host.startsWith("fc") || host.startsWith("fd")`, so bracketed `"[::1]"`, `"[fc00::1]"`, and `"[fd00::1]"` all return false. The duplicate Google Meet helper has the same behavior at `extensions/google-meet/src/setup.ts:50`, and `getVoiceCallWebhookExposureCheck()` then reports `ok: true` for those `publicUrl` values at `extensions/google-meet/src/setup.ts:65`.
- Impact: `voicecall setup`, `googlemeet setup --transport twilio`, and the runtime fail-closed guard can approve `publicUrl` values such as `http://[::1]:3334/voice/webhook` or `http://[fd00::1]/voice/webhook`. Twilio/Telnyx/Plivo callbacks will not be able to reach those URLs, so the user gets a green setup check and may start a join/call that cannot receive provider webhooks.
- Suggested fix: normalize URL hostnames before classification, for example strip IPv6 brackets and use a real IP classifier (`node:net.isIP` plus range checks, or an existing shared SSRF/private-IP helper). Add regression tests for `::`, `::1`, `fc00::/7`, `fd00::/8`, and IPv4-mapped loopback/private forms in both the shared voice-call helper and Google Meet setup path, or centralize the helper so they cannot drift.
- Confidence: high

## Details

- Do we have a high-confidence way to reproduce the issue? yes. I ran the actual helper with `pnpm exec tsx` and it returned `ok: true` for `http://[::1]:3334/voice/webhook`, `http://[fd00::1]/voice/webhook`, and `http://[fc00::1]/voice/webhook`, while correctly rejecting `http://127.0.0.1:3334/voice/webhook`.
- Is this the best way to solve the issue? yes. The failure is in hostname normalization/classification, so fixing the classifier and covering IPv6 literals is safer than patching only one caller.

## Reviewed

- Diff: `464e57360262b7e0f9a705431bedd402fe8c356b..b2aac178d6da6ccd8228d4f8e20239153da4dcb9`
- Changed files: `CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/plugins/google-meet.md`, `extensions/google-meet/index.test.ts`, `extensions/google-meet/src/setup.ts`, `extensions/voice-call/index.test.ts`, `extensions/voice-call/src/cli.ts`, `extensions/voice-call/src/runtime.test.ts`, `extensions/voice-call/src/runtime.ts`, `extensions/voice-call/src/webhook-exposure.ts`
- Code read: Google Meet setup/runtime/tool path, voice-call CLI setup, runtime public webhook guard, new webhook exposure helper, adjacent config/provider contracts, changed tests, relevant Google Meet docs sections.
- Dependencies/web: no dependency files changed; no web lookup needed.

## Tests / Live Checks

- `pnpm docs:list`
- `pnpm install` after the first test run showed missing `vitest/package.json`
- `pnpm test extensions/voice-call/src/runtime.test.ts extensions/voice-call/index.test.ts extensions/google-meet/index.test.ts` passed: 3 files, 94 tests.
- `pnpm exec tsx ...extensions/voice-call/src/webhook-exposure.ts...` reproduced the IPv6 false-negative.

## Limitations

- I did not run the full changed gate; this was a focused report-only review.
