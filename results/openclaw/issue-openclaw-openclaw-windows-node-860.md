# issue-openclaw-openclaw-windows-node-860

Repo: openclaw/openclaw-windows-node

Run: [https://github.com/openclaw/clawsweeper/actions/runs/28265737565](https://github.com/openclaw/clawsweeper/actions/runs/28265737565)

Workflow conclusion: failure

Worker result: planned

Canonical: https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw-windows-node/issues/860

## Summary

Issue #860 remains open and viable on current main f51a8618ed7bb7554b4d753a4ff518c46cde2b65. The native chat timeline still renders all timeline rows through ScrollView/VStack, while the repo already has an ItemsRepeater virtualization pattern in nearby WinUI code. The target checkout is read-only for this worker, so no code was changed and validation was not run; this emits a scoped new-fix PR artifact for the writable executor.

## Worker Action Matrix

| Target | Action | Status | Classification | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| #19 | keep_closed | skipped |  | Closed context ref only; no mutation is valid. |
| #839 | keep_related | planned | related | Related parent tracker, not a duplicate or implementation target for this cluster. |
| #860 | fix_needed | planned | canonical | The requested feature is still absent on current main and can be handled as a narrow native chat renderer fix. |
| cluster:issue-openclaw-openclaw-windows-node-860 | build_fix_artifact | planned |  | No viable canonical PR exists; build a narrow new fix PR artifact for the executor. |
