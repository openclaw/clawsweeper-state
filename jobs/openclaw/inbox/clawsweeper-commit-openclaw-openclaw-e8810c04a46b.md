# ClawSweeper commit finding repair

ClawSweeper Repair should create or update one implementation PR from `clawsweeper/clawsweeper-commit-openclaw-openclaw-e8810c04a46b`
if the finding is still valid on latest `openclaw/openclaw@main`.

## Operator Prompt

Use the ClawSweeper commit report below as the source finding. Do not redo a
broad audit of the commit. Check latest `main`, verify the reported problem is
still present, and make the narrowest safe fix. If latest `main` already fixed
it, make no code changes and report that outcome.

Do not merge. Do not close issues. Do not handle security-sensitive findings in
this lane.

# Commit e8810c04a4

## Summary

Found two actionable issues in the new RTT wrapper. Both are preflight failures before Docker starts, so they block intended maintainer use without touching the actual Telegram harness.

## Findings

### Medium: RTT wrapper rejects the existing Convex credential path

- Kind: regression
- File: `scripts/lib/rtt-harness.ts`
- Line: 58
- Evidence: `assertRequiredEnv()` requires `OPENCLAW_QA_TELEGRAM_GROUP_ID`, `OPENCLAW_QA_TELEGRAM_DRIVER_BOT_TOKEN`, and `OPENCLAW_QA_TELEGRAM_SUT_BOT_TOKEN` before `scripts/rtt.ts` calls the wrapped Docker harness. But the wrapped lane explicitly supports `OPENCLAW_NPM_TELEGRAM_CREDENTIAL_SOURCE=convex` and forwards Convex env through `scripts/e2e/npm-telegram-live-docker.sh:16`, `scripts/e2e/npm-telegram-live-docker.sh:118`, and `scripts/e2e/npm-telegram-live-runner.ts:76`. Docs and workflow usage also point maintainers at Convex for this packaged Telegram lane: `docs/help/testing.md:184`, `docs/reference/RELEASING.md:182`, `.github/workflows/npm-telegram-beta-e2e.yml:188`.
- Impact: Maintainers using the shared leased Telegram credential pool cannot run `pnpm rtt`; the wrapper fails immediately with missing raw Telegram env even though the underlying harness would have acquired credentials from Convex.
- Suggested fix: Make the RTT preflight credential-aware. If `OPENCLAW_NPM_TELEGRAM_CREDENTIAL_SOURCE` or `OPENCLAW_QA_CREDENTIAL_SOURCE` resolves to `convex`, require the Convex site URL and role secret instead of the raw Telegram env, or defer credential validation entirely to the existing Docker harness/QA lease layer.
- Confidence: high

### Low: Documented default `pnpm rtt` command points at a non-repo harness root

- Kind: bug
- File: `scripts/rtt.ts`
- Line: 64
- Evidence: The usage examples show `pnpm rtt openclaw@beta` without `--harness-root`, but `parseArgs()` defaults `harnessRoot` to the old home-relative `Developer/clawdbot` location. A focused probe with dummy Telegram env failed before Docker with “Missing OpenClaw Telegram npm harness” for that default path. The harness script exists in this checkout at `scripts/e2e/npm-telegram-live-docker.sh`, and `pnpm rtt` is added as a root package script.
- Impact: The first documented invocation fails for normal OpenClaw checkouts unless the user knows to pass `--harness-root .`, making the new harness effectively broken by default.
- Suggested fix: Default `harnessRoot` to the current repo root, for example `process.cwd()` when invoked through the root package script, and keep `--harness-root` as an override for separate harness checkouts.
- Confidence: high

## Details

- Do we have a high-confidence way to reproduce the issue? yes. `pnpm rtt openclaw@beta --harness-root .` with only Convex credential env fails at the raw Telegram env precheck. `pnpm rtt openclaw@beta` with dummy raw Telegram env fails at the default harness-root precheck.
- Is this the best way to solve the issue? yes. Both failures are wrapper preflight issues; the safer fix is to align wrapper defaults and credential validation with the already-tested packaged Telegram harness rather than duplicate a narrower contract.

## Reviewed

- Diff: `ef270b7a28371915b6be528c1d3cc30c10182326..e8810c04a46bb5b68bc441e425be77e8212309ea`
- Changed files: `.gitignore`, `package.json`, `scripts/lib/rtt-harness.ts`, `scripts/rtt.ts`, `test/fixtures/telegram-qa-summary-rtt.json`, `test/scripts/rtt-harness.test.ts`
- Code read: full new RTT files/tests, `scripts/e2e/npm-telegram-live-docker.sh`, `scripts/e2e/npm-telegram-live-runner.ts`, Telegram QA output/credential call paths, relevant workflow/docs sections
- Dependencies/web: no dependency changes; no web lookup needed
- Commands: `pnpm docs:list`; `pnpm install`; `pnpm test test/scripts/rtt-harness.test.ts`; two focused `pnpm rtt` preflight probes; `git diff --check`

## Tests / Live Checks

- `pnpm test test/scripts/rtt-harness.test.ts`: passed after `pnpm install` because `node_modules` was initially missing.
- `pnpm rtt openclaw@beta` with dummy raw Telegram env: failed before Docker on the default harness root.
- `pnpm rtt openclaw@beta --harness-root .` with Convex credential env only: failed before Docker on missing raw Telegram env.

## Limitations

- Did not run the real Docker/Telegram RTT lane because the actionable failures reproduce before Docker, npm registry resolution, or live credentials are needed.
