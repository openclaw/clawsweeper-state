# ClawSweeper commit finding repair

ClawSweeper Repair should create or update one implementation PR from `clawsweeper/clawsweeper-commit-openclaw-openclaw-955a0e9c0f7d`
if the finding is still valid on latest `openclaw/openclaw@main`.

## Operator Prompt

Use the ClawSweeper commit report below as the source finding. Do not redo a
broad audit of the commit. Check latest `main`, verify the reported problem is
still present, and make the narrowest safe fix. If latest `main` already fixed
it, make no code changes and report that outcome.

Do not merge. Do not close issues. Do not handle security-sensitive findings in
this lane.

## Commit Finding

# Commit 955a0e9c

## Summary

Found one regression risk: same-session inferred commitments can be starved indefinitely when a normal `HEARTBEAT.md` task is due on every heartbeat tick.

## Findings

### Medium: recurring due heartbeat tasks can prevent same-session commitments from ever delivering

- Kind: regression
- File: `src/infra/heartbeat-runner.ts`
- Line: 1024
- Evidence: `firstDueCommitment` is now only selected when `dueHeartbeatTasks.length === 0` (`src/infra/heartbeat-runner.ts:1024`). When any task is due, `resolveHeartbeatRunPrompt` returns the task prompt with `hasDueCommitments: false` (`src/infra/heartbeat-runner.ts:870`), so `dueCommitmentIds` is empty and the commitment is neither attempted nor delivered. The scheduler’s follow-up pass explicitly skips the default session key (`src/infra/heartbeat-runner.ts:1866`), so same-session commitments depend on a later default heartbeat run with no due tasks. For a documented/common setup like `heartbeat.every: "5m"` and a `tasks:` entry with `interval: 5m`, `isTaskDue` is true again on every cadence tick because it uses `nowMs - lastRunMs >= intervalMs` (`src/auto-reply/heartbeat.ts:288`). The new test covers the first half of this state by asserting the due commitment stays `pending` with `attempts: 0` when a 5-minute task is due (`src/infra/heartbeat-runner.commitments.test.ts:156`), but it does not cover the next tick where the same task is due again.
- Impact: users with opt-in inferred commitments and an every-heartbeat task can stop receiving natural follow-up check-ins for that session until the commitment expires, despite docs saying due commitments are delivered through heartbeat for the same agent/channel scope.
- Suggested fix: keep task turns tool-capable, but process same-session commitments in a separate no-tools turn after the task run, or add a commitment-only wake/path that bypasses task selection without mixing untrusted commitment metadata into the tool-capable task prompt.
- Confidence: high

## Details

- Do we have a high-confidence way to reproduce the issue? yes. Configure heartbeat every 5 minutes, add a `HEARTBEAT.md` task with `interval: 5m`, seed a due commitment for the same session, and run heartbeat at `t` and `t + 5m`; the task branch wins both times and the default-session commitment pass is skipped.
- Is this the best way to solve the issue? unclear. A separate no-tools commitment turn is safest for the trust boundary, but the exact scheduling shape should avoid immediately rerunning the same due task.

## Tests / Live Checks

- `pnpm docs:list` completed.
- `git diff --check 173f959613b35195c8e4e662b9e0138831cfb4d2..955a0e9c0f7d969e7d96cade7b383b3306aadf98` passed.
- Initial focused test run failed because `node_modules` was missing; `pnpm install` succeeded.
- `pnpm test src/infra/heartbeat-runner.commitments.test.ts src/infra/heartbeat-runner.returns-default-unset.test.ts` passed: 41 tests.

## Dependency / Web Checks

- No dependency files changed; no external web lookup needed.

## Limitations

- I did not run the broad changed gate.
- An inline `tsx` smoke attempt was stopped because importing the runner staged bundled plugin runtime dependencies and did not reach scenario output quickly enough.
