# ClawSweeper commit finding repair

ClawSweeper Repair should create or update one implementation PR from `clawsweeper/clawsweeper-commit-openclaw-openclaw-ac599c9e539f`
if the finding is still valid on latest `openclaw/openclaw@main`.

## Operator Prompt

Use the ClawSweeper commit report below as the source finding. Do not redo a
broad audit of the commit. Check latest `main`, verify the reported problem is
still present, and make the narrowest safe fix. If latest `main` already fixed
it, make no code changes and report that outcome.

Do not merge. Do not close issues. Do not handle security-sensitive findings in
this lane.

## Commit Finding

- Commit: https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/commit/ac599c9e539f5e4f8b3df15a12123da5808ff9e6

# Commit ac599c9e

## Summary

Found one runtime-deps selection gap. The new managed `node-llama-cpp` dependency is retained for explicit `provider: "local"`, but not for other supported local-provider paths.

## Findings

### Medium: Local memory runtime deps are skipped for auto-selected or fallback local embeddings

- Kind: bug
- File: `src/plugins/bundled-runtime-deps-selection.ts`
- Line: 389
- Evidence: `isMemoryEmbeddingProviderConfiguredForRuntimeDeps` only checks whether `agents.defaults.memorySearch.provider` or `agents.list[].memorySearch.provider` is exactly `"local"`, and the dependency is included only through that predicate at line 733. Current memory runtime config also supports `provider: "auto"` with `local.modelPath` auto-selecting the local adapter, and `fallback: "local"` creating the local adapter after a primary provider failure. A focused planner probe showed: explicit local includes `node-llama-cpp@3.18.1`, while `auto` plus `local.modelPath` and `provider: "openai", fallback: "local"` only include the base plugin deps.
- Impact: Packaged installs using documented auto local selection, or remote embeddings with local fallback, can still hit the same missing `node-llama-cpp` failure after `openclaw doctor --fix`, because the managed runtime-deps plan never retains the native package for those valid configs.
- Suggested fix: Treat local memory runtime deps as required when the effective memory embedding path can resolve to local: explicit `provider: "local"`, `fallback: "local"`, custom provider IDs whose `models.providers.<id>.api` resolves to local, and `provider` unset/`"auto"` when local auto-selection evidence such as `local.modelPath` is configured and usable.
- Confidence: high

## Details

- Do we have a high-confidence way to reproduce the issue? yes. Build a packaged-runtime-deps fixture with `runtimeDependencies.localMemoryEmbedding = ["node-llama-cpp@3.18.1"]`, then scan configs for explicit local, auto local model path, and fallback local. The current scanner only includes `node-llama-cpp` for explicit local.
- Is this the best way to solve the issue? yes, directionally. The dep selection should match the same provider-resolution contract used by memory runtime setup, otherwise doctor/startup repair gives users a false clean state.

## Reviewed

- Diff: `9d037d2f5ad71da195778ac6ba469023d21ef8e7..ac599c9e539f5e4f8b3df15a12123da5808ff9e6`
- Changed files: `CHANGELOG.md`, memory docs, `extensions/memory-core/openclaw.plugin.json`, `provider-adapters.ts`, `bundled-runtime-deps-selection.ts`, tests, fixtures
- Code read: changed files, runtime-deps collection/repair/load paths, memory provider resolution, local/fallback embedding creation, startup/doctor callers
- Issue context: `https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/74777`

## Tests / Live Checks

- `pnpm install`
- `pnpm test src/plugins/bundled-runtime-deps.test.ts -- --run -t "local memory embedding runtime deps"` passed
- `pnpm exec tsx -e <runtime-deps planner probe>` reproduced missing `node-llama-cpp` for auto/fallback local configs
- `git diff --check 9d037d2f5ad71da195778ac6ba469023d21ef8e7..ac599c9e539f5e4f8b3df15a12123da5808ff9e6` passed

## Dependency / Web Checks

- `gh issue view 74777` confirmed the intended fix scope and reporter’s explicit-local failure.
- `npm view node-llama-cpp@3.18.1 ...` checked package metadata; no separate supply-chain finding.

## Limitations

- Did not run the full changed gate.
- Did not run an end-to-end packaged local embedding session with a real GGUF model; the finding is from source tracing plus a focused runtime-deps planner probe.
