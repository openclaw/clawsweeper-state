# Gitcrawl Cluster 6257

Generated from local gitcrawl run cluster 6257 for `openclaw/openclaw`.

Display title:

> fix: use SSRF-guarded fetch for TTS provider requests

Cluster shape from gitcrawl:

- total members: 5
- issues: 0
- pull requests: 5
- open candidates in local store: 2
- representative: #46333, currently closed in local store
- latest member update: 2026-04-27T22:51:39.179963047Z

## Goal

Run one live autonomous classification pass. Classify open candidates only, verify live GitHub state, choose the current canonical issue or PR if the representative is obsolete, and emit only high-confidence planned close/comment/label actions. Closed context refs are evidence only and must not receive close actions.

## Member Inventory

Closed context refs:

- #43273 fix: validate Edge TTS output file is non-empty before reporting success
- #46333 fix: use SSRF-guarded fetch for TTS provider requests
- #47232 improve: add empty-text guard and retry for Edge TTS

Open candidates:

- #61517 fix(ollama): use SSRF-guarded fetch in streaming path
- #67484 extensions(ollama): strip ollama/ prefix from model ID before API call
