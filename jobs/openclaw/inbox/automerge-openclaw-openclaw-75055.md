# ClawSweeper adopted PR repair candidate

Maintainer opted #75055 into ClawSweeper automerge.

Source PR: https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/75055
Title: fix(security): stop implicit tool grants from config sections (#47487)

ClawSweeper should use this job only for the bounded ClawSweeper review/fix loop:

- If ClawSweeper emits an explicit repair marker, requests changes, or finds failing checks/rebase work, and the PR branch is safe to update, emit a fix artifact with `repair_strategy: "repair_contributor_branch"` and `source_prs: ["https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/75055"]`.
- If the PR branch cannot be safely updated, emit a narrow credited replacement only when the artifact can preserve the original contributor credit; otherwise return `needs_human`.
- For user-facing OpenClaw `fix`, `feat`, or `perf` changes, inspect the changelog policy and add or repair a `CHANGELOG.md` entry with contributor attribution before declaring the branch merge-ready.
- Do not merge, close, or bypass review gates from the worker. The comment router owns final merge only after a passing ClawSweeper verdict for the exact current head.
- Keep repair scope limited to actionable ClawSweeper findings, failing relevant checks, and required review feedback on this PR.
