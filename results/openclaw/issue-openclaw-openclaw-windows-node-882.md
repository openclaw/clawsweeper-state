# issue-openclaw-openclaw-windows-node-882

Repo: openclaw/openclaw-windows-node

Run: [https://github.com/openclaw/clawsweeper/actions/runs/28320071409](https://github.com/openclaw/clawsweeper/actions/runs/28320071409)

Workflow conclusion: failure

Worker result: blocked

Canonical: https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw-windows-node/issues/882

## Summary

Issue #882 is open, non-security-sensitive, and still valid on current main 87dc3dc79d7c3e9a844cdb2f09773735a76c4f18. Source inspection still shows no tray-side NO_REPLY suppression guard for live assistant chat events or chat.history assistant rows. Implementation and validation are blocked because this worker filesystem is read-only, so no branch change or PR can be produced directly; a narrow fix artifact is emitted for the applicator/executor.

## Worker Action Matrix

| Target | Action | Status | Classification | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| #882 | fix_needed | planned | canonical | A narrow implementation remains appropriate: suppress exact/trimmed assistant NO_REPLY directives in the tray provider before visible timeline entries are created, while preserving legitimate user-authored NO_REPLY text. |
| cluster:issue-openclaw-openclaw-windows-node-882 | build_fix_artifact | planned |  | No active implementation PR exists in the hydrated artifact and allow_fix_pr=true. |
| cluster:issue-openclaw-openclaw-windows-node-882 | open_fix_pr | blocked |  | Implementation PR creation is blocked by the read-only worker filesystem, not by product ambiguity or security policy. |

## Needs Human

- none
